// Interfacing Relay module to demonstrate Bluetooth based home automation application.  
(using Bluetooth and relay).

/*

Components:

Arduino (or any other microcontroller)
Bluetooth module (HC-05 or HC-06)
Relay module
Power supply for the relay module (if required)
Home appliances or devices to control (e.g., a lamp)
Steps:

Set Up Arduino:

Connect the Arduino to your computer.
Install the necessary drivers and the Arduino IDE.
Connect Bluetooth Module:

Connect the Bluetooth module (HC-05 or HC-06) to the Arduino using the serial pins (TX and RX). Make sure to connect VCC and GND appropriately.
Connect Relay Module:

Connect the relay module to the Arduino. Typically, relay modules have a VCC, GND, and signal pin. Connect the VCC and GND to the appropriate power supply, and connect the signal pin to a digital pin on the Arduino.
Connect Home Appliance to Relay:

Connect the home appliance or device that you want to control to one of the relay outputs on the relay module.
Upload Arduino Code:

Write an Arduino sketch to control the relay based on Bluetooth commands. You can use the SoftwareSerial library to communicate with the Bluetooth module. Here's a basic example:

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

SoftwareSerial bluetooth(10, 11); // RX, TX

int relayPin = 2; // Digital pin connected to relay module

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  bluetooth.begin(9600);
  pinMode(relayPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  if (bluetooth.available() > 0) {
    char command = bluetooth.read();
    if (command == '1') {
      digitalWrite(relayPin, HIGH); // Turn on relay
    } else if (command == '0') {
      digitalWrite(relayPin, LOW); // Turn off relay
    }
  }
}

Pair Bluetooth Module:

Pair your Bluetooth-enabled device (e.g., smartphone) with the Bluetooth module on the Arduino.
Control Using Bluetooth:

Use a Bluetooth terminal app on your smartphone to send '1' to turn on the relay (and the connected appliance) and '0' to turn it off.
Test:

Test the system by sending commands via Bluetooth and observing the relay's behavior.
Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and you may need to adapt the code and connections based on your specific modules and requirements. Additionally, ensure that you follow safety precautions when working with high-voltage appliances and circuits.
