PGDCA IOT SYLLABUS:

Practical using Arduino-Interfacing Sensors :  
1. Installation of Arduino IDE  
2. Interfacing Light Emitting Diode (LED)- Blinking LED  
3. Interfacing Button and LED – LED blinking when button is pressed.  
4. Interfacing Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and LED, displaying automatic night lamp  
5. Interfacing Temperature Sensor (LM35) and/or humidity sensor (e.g. DHT11)  
6. Interfacing Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) – display data generated by sensor on LCD  
7. Interfacing Air Quality Sensor-pollution (e.g. MQ135) - display data on LCD, switch on LED  
when data sensed is higher than specified value.  
8. Interfacing Bluetooth module (e.g. HC05)- receiving data from mobile phone on Arduino  
and display on LCD  
9. Interfacing Relay module to demonstrate Bluetooth based home automation application.  
(using Bluetooth and relay).
